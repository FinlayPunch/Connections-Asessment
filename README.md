<h1>Connections for Python</h1>

<b1>By Finlay Punch</b1><br><br>

<b2>This is a version of the New York Times game Connections made expressly for use in the Python terminal. It was made by me over the course of 2 months for my Task 1 assessment for Year 11 Software Engineering.

<h1>How to play</h1>

<b1>Connections for Python functions in the same way as the base Connections on the New York Times website.</b1><br><br>

<b2>
1. <b>16 words</b> are randomly generated and placed in a <b>4x4 grid</b>, they are divided into <b>four hidden categories</b>.<br>
2. One must figure out the <b>connections</b> between the words and group them into <b>sets of four</b>; grouped words become a category.<br>
3. The user can enter their four guesses into the <b>terminal</b>, the program will determine whether they are right or wrong.<br>
4. You have <b>four chances</b> to group words into categories.<br>
5. If <b>all four guesses</b> are correct then you win.<br>
