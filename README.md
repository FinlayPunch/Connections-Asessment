<h1>Connections for Python</h1>
<b1>By Finlay Punch</b1><br><br>
<b2>This is a version of the New York Times game Connections made expressly for use in the Python terminal. It was made by me over the course of 2 months for my Task 1 assessment for Year 11 Software Engineering.</b2>
<h1>How to play</h1>
<b1>Connections for Python functions in the same way as the base Connections on the New York Times website.</b1><br>
